| --------------- | --------------------- |
| Secret Delivery | Kubernetes Secret     |
| Consumption     | Environment Variables |
| Pod Restart     | ✅ Required            |
| Rotation        | 🟡 Partial            |
| Sync Interval   | Vault TTL based       |
| Simplicity      | 🟢 Medium             |

Important Notes

⚠️ Kubernetes does NOT update environment variables in running pods
⚠️ Even if the Secret updates, the pod must restart

Pros

Simple Kubernetes-native pattern

Easy for application teams

Clear ownership model

Cons

Pod restarts required

Risk of downtime for stateful apps

Secrets briefly exist in etcd
Best Use Case

✔️ Applications that can tolerate restarts
✔️ Legacy apps expecting env vars
